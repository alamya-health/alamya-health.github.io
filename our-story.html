						<h3>Our Observations</h3>
						<p>
							Today people who have a genetic disorder often wait 5-10 years for a diagnosis –  if they receive one at all. 
							We, the Alamya Health founder team, bring decades of observed and lived experience supporting families through their diagnostic odysseys. 
							We have seen first-hand how this journey can lead to suffering through uncertainty, lack of specialized care, and medical bankruptcy - this is in addition to the pain already caused by symptoms. 
							We have observed how the absence of a precise answer can result in death for treatable disorders. 
						</p>

						<h3>Our Solutions</h3>
						<p>
							These challenges are all too common given that approximately 1 in every 10 individuals around the world has a genomic disorder. 
							With more than 10,000 genomic disorders currently identified and extensive variability in clinical presentation between individuals, even within families,  precision medicine has been moving towards computer assisted diagnosis – making it possible to enhance the capacity of the individual diagnostician. 
							Integrating transdisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives into a robust knowledge framework, we at Alamya Health distill existing scientific and medical knowledge to support health and well-being.  
							We capture and organize vast data into tools that advance precision medicine for all. At Alamya Health, we are highly motivated to disrupt the diagnostic status quo and we recognize that now is the time to do so.  
							Our foundational technologies are backed by strong data science and artificial intelligence, which enable Alamya Health to offer transparent evidence for diagnoses at a fraction of the cost and in a matter of days, not years.
						</p>

						<h3>Our Community</h3>
						<p>
							Each member of the uniquely comprehensive founding team is a thought leader who brings a unique wealth of knowledge, commitment, and vision to the company’s mission. 
							This dedication has been evident since day one. 
							Conceived and organized as a public benefit corporation, Alamya Health is using the latest genomics technology to advance social and public good. 
							By contributing our time, passion, and subject matter expertise for more than a year, the founding team at Alamya has positioned the company to advance the integration of multi-modal genomics into the clinical space at the point of care worldwide.
						</p>
						
						<h3>Our Commitment</h3>
						<p>
							The advancement of multi-modal long-read sequencing promises to reduce the time to diagnosis for many such families, to provide biomarkers of disease and therapeutic efficacy, and to enable risk assessment for predisposition to future disease. 
							But the promise of long-read is just that - still a promise. To realize that promise, the synergistic effect of many disciplines must converge to create the infrastructure, analytics, and distributed cognition required to solve a problem as vast as maximizing human health and well-being. 
							The founding team at Alamya Health have dedicated our professional and personal lives to this effort.
