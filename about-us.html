									<h2>Rosanna Weksberg</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/RosannaWeksberg_Square.png" alt="Dr. Weksberg" /></span>Dr. Weksberg received a PhD and MD at the University of Toronto, Toronto Canada. A Professor of Pediatrics and Genetics at the University of Toronto, Rosanna holds a graduate appointment in the Institute of Medical Science. 
										<br><br>She works at The Hospital for Sick Children as a Clinical Geneticist in the Division of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics and a Senior Associate Scientist in the Research Institute and is an Associate Editor for the American Journal of Medical Genetics. The research in her lab explores the impact of genetic and environmental factors on epigenetic marks and their role in a variety of human genetic diseases and relevant animal models. Recent work highlights the study of genome–wide epigenetic variation in different normal human tissues as well as in neurodevelopmental syndromes, including autism and epilepsy. 
										<br><br>In 2015, Rosanna and her team discovered genome-wide DNA methylation alterations downstream of gene mutations in NSD1, a histone methyltransferase. Now ~100genes that function in epigenetic regulation are known to generate gene/disorder-specific genome-wide DNA methylation alterations. These DNA methylation signatures are actively being translated into diagnostic tests. She is now also focusing on using DNA methylation alterations to develop novel therapeutics for neurodevelopmental disorders and to monitor therapeutic efficacy.
